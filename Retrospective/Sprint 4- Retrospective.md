# RETROSPECTIVE of THIRD SPRINT (Team R02)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Committed Stories:  ; Stories Done: 
- Committed Points: ; Points Done: 
- Planned Hours: ; Spent Hours:


**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual     |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------------- |
| | | | | |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)


Story 0 in-depth - fixing Git issues:
- Navbar color contrast issue -> Navbar was completely redesigned 


Sprint statistics
- Average hour per task: (hours)/(#tasks)= hours; 
- Standard deviation: 
- Total task estimation error ratio: 

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated:  ( hours for implementing unit tests) 
  - Total hours spent:  
  - Nr of automated unit test cases :  (for BackEnd) +  (for FrontEnd) =  unit test cases

- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated:  - included inside each story
  - Total hours spent: 
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated:  - included inside each story
  - Total hours spent: 
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube:  (only in Maintainability - fixing code smells)
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues:  (only in New Code - Maintainability - fixing code smells)
  - Hours spent on remediation: 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 0.3%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ): Reliability - A, Security - A, Maintainability - A

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Visual design & usability improvement proved really tough (especially making every page design consistent with the rest) so we overspent some hours for this task.
  - API testing integration proved to be less difficult due to the repetitive nature of the API calls.
  - The Story # (Disabled users) proved very difficult and by sacrificing time for it (still could not finish) we ended up with less time on the Story # (Unpicked food) and we completed none of the stories.



- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Story integration was not as swift as we expected. We faced some initial difficulty on integrating our previously implemented stories with the new ones
  - Documentation (the Git readme) proved to be very helpful and we often used it as a “manual” to quickly search and get the information we needed
  - At the end of this sprint we were able to deliver a much better looking and much more responsive app. This step helped us better understand the effects of a better design on the stakeholders feedback and “happiness”



- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - Design & usability was very much improved. 
  - Different alerts and interactive buttons were placed throughout the app. 
  - API test suite coverage went up from less than 50% to higher than 90%. 


- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - We achieved all of the goals set in the previous retrospective


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - We want to further improve the site design by making it more intuitive, using more icons and creating a very consistent design and work-flow in every page of the app.
  - We should increase the documentation for each component that we create. In this way others can quickly edit and adapt components without breaking the app.
  - We should try to finish our tasks earlier so there is enough time to check that every new feature was correctly integrated.


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Cooperation! Every team member did their best to help in delivering a working app for the last sprint of the course.
